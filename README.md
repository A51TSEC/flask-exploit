#  Flask DoS vulnerability poc

#  Example of usage:

Send header to flask server <=> Flask 0.12.x.

You can use: Insomnia, Servistate or any REST client or request lib in python, etc.

Notice, I used OPTION header method. It is possible to use PATCH and custom headers.

We put data into requested url, header and header data as seen on video.

#Impact

Server will not respond after header gets to server and no logs will be recorded.
